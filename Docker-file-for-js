# ==============================
# Stage 1: Build the Node.js application
# ==============================

# Use the official Node.js 16 image as the base for building the app
FROM node:16 AS build

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the container
# This allows Docker to cache npm install if dependencies don't change
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the remaining application code to the container
COPY . . 


# ==============================
# Stage 2: Runtime image
# ==============================

# Use a lightweight Node.js 16-slim image for runtime
FROM node:16-slim

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the built application and installed node_modules from the build stage
COPY --from=build /app /app

# Expose the port the app will run on
EXPOSE 9090

# Command to start the application
